description: Refresh the local ChatGPT app reference source from the installed macOS ChatGPT.app asar. Use when Codex needs to get the latest installed ChatGPT app code, recreate ./ref from /Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar, or format extracted JavaScript and CSS while excluding ref/node_modules.

# ChatGPT App Ref Refresh

## Workflow

Use this skill from the repository root that should receive `./ref`.

1. Verify the current working directory is the intended workspace.
2. Run the bundled script:

```bash
node .agents/skills/codex-app-ref-refresh/scripts/refresh-codex-ref.mjs
```

The script runs three steps in order:

1. **Sync** — deletes only `<cwd>/ref`, then extracts `/Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar` into a fresh `ref` directory.
2. **Format** — runs Prettier (`--write --ignore-path /dev/null`) over every extracted `.js` and `.css` file, skipping any `node_modules` directory under `ref`. This intentionally bypasses `.gitignore` and `.prettierignore` so an ignored `ref/` directory is still formatted. After writing, the script verifies JavaScript files with `--list-different --ignore-path /dev/null` and reruns Prettier on any remaining JS files. CSS is formatted but not used as a hard verification gate because bundled Tailwind CSS can be non-idempotent under Prettier. This step is **always on** by default; do not skip it unless the user explicitly asks.
3. **Report** — prints the count of formatted files and a completion line.

Formatting the synced JS and CSS with Prettier is a required part of the refresh, not an optional extra. The minified asar output is unreadable until formatted, so always let the Prettier step run. Only pass `--skip-format` when the user explicitly wants raw, unformatted extraction.

## Verify

After the run, confirm formatting actually completed before reporting success:

- The script logs `Formatting N JS/CSS file(s) with Prettier, ignoring git/prettier ignore files...`, `Prettier verification complete.`, and then `ChatGPT app ref refresh complete.`
- If the script logs `Prettier verification found N file(s) needing another pass; reformatting...`, that is acceptable only when it is followed by `Prettier verification complete.`
- If formatting was skipped, the script logs `Skipping Prettier formatting.` instead — treat that as an incomplete refresh unless `--skip-format` was intentional.
- Spot-check that a known JS or CSS file under `ref` is multi-line (Prettier-formatted), not a single minified line.
- If running a manual Prettier verification against `ref`, include `--ignore-path /dev/null`; otherwise Prettier may skip files because `ref/` is git-ignored. Prefer strict manual checks for JS files only.

## Options

- Set `CHATGPT_APP_ASAR=/path/to/app.asar` before running when the ChatGPT app bundle lives somewhere else. The legacy `CODEX_APP_ASAR` variable remains supported for compatibility.
- Pass `--skip-format` only when the user explicitly wants extraction without Prettier formatting.
- Pass `--dry-run` to inspect the resolved paths without deleting or extracting anything.

## Safety

- Do not run the script from the wrong directory; it intentionally replaces `./ref`.
- Prefer the script over manually chaining `rm`, `npx @electron/asar`, and `prettier`, because the script guards the target path and consistently excludes `ref/node_modules`.
- After running, report the extracted `ref` path and whether formatting completed.
