# Project profile — codex-app-code `./ref`

Use this profile whenever the task targets this repo's extracted Codex.app
bundle under `./ref`. It narrows the generic Vite/Rollup restoration workflow
so agents spend effort on app code instead of rediscovering the local layout.

← Back to [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Primary workflow:
[full-restoration.md](../workflows/full-restoration.md).

## Scope map

- `ref/package.json` identifies the extracted app as
  `openai-codex-electron`; use it as dependency evidence, not an absolute
  oracle. Missing entries in the extracted package file or `ref/node_modules`
  do **not** justify hand-writing a local compatibility layer for a
  high-confidence third-party package.
- `ref/webview/index.html` names the browser entry and modulepreload roots.
  Read it before picking an entry when the user says "restore ./ref".
- `ref/webview/assets/*.js` is the bundled code root. These chunks are the
  normal input for the deobfuscation workflow.
- `ref/webview/assets/*.css`, WASM, fonts, images, and animation/data files are
  assets. Preserve or reference them; do not turn them into TS/TSX unless a JS
  chunk wraps them.
- `ref/node_modules/**` is extracted dependency/native-module source. Use it for
  package identity and API shape, not as a target for bundle restoration. Its
  absence is weak evidence only; public npm boundaries should still externalize
  confirmed packages and record any needed ambient declaration/install note.
- `ref/native-menu-locales/**` is JSON data. Treat it as a data source, not a JS
  restoration target.

## Default command frame

For a main app restore or continuation:

```bash
SKILL_DIR=.agents/skills/deobfuscate-javascript
# Auto-discover the entry from index.html (do NOT hard-code the hash — they
# rotate every build). Falls back to globbing app-main-*.js if you prefer:
ENTRY=$(bun "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/check-entry.ts" --discover --root ref/webview/assets)
TARGET=restored
FULL="$TARGET/.deobfuscate-javascript/_full"

bun "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/sourcemap-check.ts" "$ENTRY" || true
# --discover already confirmed the entry is the app, not a vendor leaf (exit 3 = leaf).
bun "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/build-import-graph.ts" "$ENTRY" \
  --target "$TARGET" \
  --root ref/webview/assets \
  --max-lines 0
bun "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/build-symbol-ledger.ts" \
  --target "$TARGET" \
  --manifest "$FULL/manifest.json" \
  --out "$FULL/ledger.json"
bun "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/auto-restore-full.ts" --target "$TARGET" --format
```

Always resolve the hashed entry from `ref/webview/index.html` or by globbing
`app-main-*.js` — chunk hashes rotate every build (the snapshot this profile was
written against used `app-main-DG-Mf4Wj.js`; later snapshots differ). The
`<script>` root in `index.html` is the true bootstrap; `app-main-*` is the usual
deep-restore target because it has the largest local fan-out.

## Resume before rebuilding

Before running graph or auto-restore scripts, inspect existing restoration
state:

```bash
find restored -maxdepth 3 \( -name README.md -o -name 'IMPORT_MAP.json' \)
find restored \( -path '*/.deobfuscate-javascript/_full/manifest.json' -o -path '*/.deobfuscate-javascript/_full/ledger.json' \)
```

If `TARGET/.deobfuscate-javascript/_full/manifest.json` and `ledger.json`
exist, resume from them unless the user explicitly asked to rebuild or the
entry hash changed. Reuse the single shared `restored/IMPORT_MAP.json` (one map
at the restore root, regardless of entry).

## Boundary classification

Use `--max-lines 0` for true deep restores, but do not treat every reachable
asset-like chunk as a feature module:

- Known npm chunks should become bare imports. If a package-like chunk basename
  matches `ref/package.json` dependencies or a well-known package entry, extend
  `CHUNK_NAME_REGISTRY` / use `--treat-as-npm` rather than restoring vendor
  internals as app code.
- **`@pierre/trees` + `@pierre/diffs` (file tree + diff views) → vendored
  package boundaries, NOT app code.** Codex bundles these two published packages
  inline: the file tree is `@pierre/trees` (npm `1.0.0-beta.4`; built on
  **Preact**, exports `.`/`./react`/`./ssr`/`./web-components`) and the diff view
  is `@pierre/diffs` (`1.2.11`; deps `shiki ^3`, `@pierre/theme`, `@pierre/theming`,
  `diff`; exports `.`/`./react`/`./worker`). Recognize the family by fingerprint,
  not basename:
  - CSS tokens `--trees-*` (`--trees-row-height`, `--trees-file-icon-color-rust`,
    `--trees-git-modified-color`) and `--diffs-*` (`--diffs-addition-base`,
    `--diffs-line-bg`, `--diffs-column-number-width`).
  - DOM attrs `data-file-tree-*` (`-virtualized-root`, `-sticky-row`,
    `-search-input`), `data-diffs-header`, `data-diff-type`, `data-diff-span`.
  - The `pierre-light`/`pierre-dark`(+`-soft`) Shiki themes, and the residual
    `/** @pierre/truncate css here, manually copy pasted for now */` comment.
  - Renderer cluster (the package engine): `file-tree-search-input-*` (the tree),
    `shiki-highlight-provider-gate-*` (the `@pierre/diffs` **main-entry/gate**),
    `file-diff-*`, `diff-unified-*`, `parsePatchFiles-*`, and the highlight
    `worker-*` chunk.

  **Codex FORKED these, so a clean bare swap is usually INFEASIBLE.** The bundled
  chunks are not pristine upstream copies — e.g. `file-tree-search-input` ships a
  **React fork** of the Preact `@pierre/trees` and exports
  `FileTree`/`FileTreeSearchInput`/`extractFilePathFromEvent` that don't exist
  upstream; the `@pierre/diffs` gate is entangled with Codex inputs (settings
  `lightCodeThemeId`/`darkCodeThemeId`, app-scope store, window-context route
  gating); `FileDiff` wraps the renderer in a settings-driven theming layer
  (`var(--codex-diffs-surface)`). Treatment, in order of cleanliness:
  - **Clean leaves → real bare import.** The highlight worker (no Codex logic,
    `ShikiError`+`set-render-options`+`data-diff-span`, sole dep an Oniguruma WASM)
    → `@pierre/diffs/worker`. The self-contained patch parser (`parsePatchFiles`,
    0 imports, `diffs-container`/`--diffs-scrollbar-gutter-measured` fingerprints)
    → `@pierre/diffs` — but reconcile the layout/CSS constants its consumers also
    pull (`DIFFS_CONTAINER_CLASS`, `MAX_DIFF_SIZE`, `THEME_BY_MODE`, …) against the
    real public surface; keep a re-exporting facade if not all are public.
  - **Forked / entangled engine → keep the wrapper, relabel + boundary-ize.** Do
    NOT delete the forked file or pretend it's upstream. Mark it a vendored
    `@pierre/*` boundary (provenance header + `quality-gate.ts --vendored`), keep
    the thin Codex wrapper, and lift Codex-local inputs to props/config.
  - Themes `pierre-*` → `@pierre/theme` data (low priority; fine as inline frozen
    JSON, relabel optional).
  - **Mechanics in this restore:** there is no vendored `node_modules`; bare npm
    imports type-check via ambient `declare module "…"` stubs in
    `restored/globals.d.ts` (alongside `clsx`, `zod`, `@radix-ui/*`). So
    externalizing = add `@pierre/trees`/`@pierre/diffs`/`@pierre/diffs/*`/
    `@pierre/theme` ambient decls + reclassify the chunk in the IMPORT_MAP +
    provenance relabel — not a node_modules install.

  **Basename traps — these are NOT Pierre, leave them as restored Codex/data:**
  `diff-stats-*` (animated git-stat badge, react-intl + Codex i18n),
  `diff-view-mode-*` (Codex editor-theme catalog + settings enum),
  `use-diff-annotations-*` (PDF.js annotation layer + Codex review-comment
  threading — decisive: the real `diff-unified` renderer imports FROM it),
  `parse-diff-*` (Codex size-guard wrapper around `parsePatchFiles`),
  `grammars/diffGrammar.ts` (`diff-*` = Shiki TextMate `source.diff` grammar),
  `treeView-SZITEDCU-*` / `treemap-*` (Mermaid/d3 diagram vendor),
  `worktree-*` / `pending-worktree-*` (git-worktree features). And the genuine
  Codex consumers that merely _use_ the surface — `review-*`,
  `pull-request-code-review-comments-*`, `thread-side-panel-tabs-*`,
  `workspace-directory-tree-*`, `editor-diff-page-*` — stay restored.

- Syntax grammar, theme, locale, Mermaid, KaTeX, PDF, workbook, and protobuf
  runtime chunks may be public output, but they should be compact semantic
  facades or data modules. Do not invent app-specific component names for them.
- Feature chunks named after product concepts (`composer-*`,
  `composer-controller-*`, `local-conversation-*`, `conversation-*`,
  `thread-*`, `review-*`, `plugins-*`, `mcp-*`, `settings-*`,
  `pets-settings-*`, `app-shell-*`, `app-server-*`, `native-apps-*`) and any
  app-facing `*-page-*` / `*-panel-*` chunk deserve Stage 3 semantic splitting
  and typed TS/TSX surfaces. `pdf-preview-panel-*` is a panel by default; do not
  turn it into `export {}` or a doc/vendor boundary merely because it references
  PDF/doc renderer internals. Prove a chunk is genuine vendor/data by fingerprint
  before boundary-izing it.
- If a consumer only needs a boundary name from an unfinished huge **third-party
  runtime** chunk, leave a documented facade and revisit the runtime only when the
  user scopes it. **Facing applies to genuine vendor/runtime chunks only — never to
  app/feature chunks** (`app-shell-*`, `app-main-*`, pages, panels, components,
  contexts, hooks); those are recursively restored even when large or widely
  imported. A facade is an _open boundary_, so a deep/full restore is **not
  complete** while one stands in for a project-local chunk. Generate it
  mechanically: `make-facade.ts <chunk> --provenance ref/webview/assets/<basename>.js`
  emits a typed `export declare const … : any` facade (reserved-word-safe — the Zod
  `src` chunk literally exports `in`), then `ledger.ts mark-faced <basename>`
  (which refuses app-entry basenames without `--force`) so the chunk's many
  consumers stop waiting on it and become restorable. Record the alias map under
  `dependencyBoundaryFacades` in the project IMPORT_MAP. The vendor/runtime
  chunks that warrant a typed **`any`-facade** in this repo are the genuine app/host
  runtime: the React/react-query `app-scope` layer, the `vscode-api`/host bridge,
  the Codex `rpc`/`host-config`/`product-logger`/persisted-signal runtime — and the
  app is made runnable before they are restored via `make-facade.ts --passthrough`
  (re-exports the original ref chunk under `@ts-nocheck` + `// TODO`).

### Bundled third-party packages — resolve to bare re-exports, not facades

Many Codex boundary chunks are stock npm packages the bundler renamed after an
internal module (`isEqual-*`, `lib-*`, `single-value-*`, `chunk-XXXX-*`), so
`CHUNK_NAME_REGISTRY`'s stem match misses them. Once identified, the deliverable is
a **bare re-export shim** (`make-facade.ts <chunk> --reexport <specifier>`), not an
`any`-facade — `boundaries/highlight-js-core.ts` is the model. The map seen in this
repo (record the package in IMPORT_MAP `vendor`; `classifyBoundary()` reads it):

| Boundary file (chunk)                                     | npm specifier                  | notes                                                           |

| `markdown-ast.ts` (`lib-CqEvD6Nn`)                        | `mdast-util-*`                 | confirm the exact util                                          |
| `parse-patch-files.ts` (`parsePatchFiles-*`)              | `@pierre/diffs`                | **forked** — see Pierre note; keep wrapper if it diverges       |
| `src.ts` (`src-*`)                                        | `zod`                          | verify it is stock Zod, not a fork                              |

| `radix-*.ts` (`dist-*`, `Combination-*`)                  | `@radix-ui/react-*`            | per-primitive; **may be forked**                                |

**Fork caveat:** `@pierre/*`, `@radix-ui/*`, and `zod`(`src`) may be Codex forks, not
stock npm. Before swapping to a bare specifier, confirm the export surface matches
stock. Prefer `ref/node_modules` proof when available, but do not require it for
unforked, high-confidence packages already listed above: `formatjs.ts` /
`lib-BWT6A3Q0` is `react-intl` even if the extracted app snapshot lacks
`ref/node_modules/react-intl` or a `react-intl` package entry. The same rule
applies to React Router, cmdk, TanStack React Form, React companion packages
(`react-dom/client`, `react-is`, `use-sync-external-store`), react-colorful,
dotLottie React, Day.js, Jotai, `@dnd-kit/*`, and other high-confidence registry
packages. In
that case emit the npm-backed re-export shim, add the package root to the
restored project `package.json`, and keep ambient module declarations only when
the package's own types are still unavailable; do not create a local "minimal"
replacement for a stock package. For generic package chunks whose public name is
not self-identifying, keep a provenance-keyed gate entry too: the current
FormatJS chunk `lib-BWT6A3Q0` must be treated as `react-intl` even if a future
restore writes it to a differently named `vendor/*` shim.
For a confirmed fork keep the forked wrapper and boundary-ize it
(`quality-gate.ts --vendored`).

## Semantic rewrite playbook

When converting checkpoints into public files:

- Use chunk basename as a hint, then confirm with UI text, query keys, route
  paths, action IDs, localStorage keys, plugin IDs, IPC/channel names, CSS class
  names, and consumer imports.
- Group output by product domain (kebab-case directory names): `app`,
  `app-shell`, `composer`, `conversations`, `threads`, `settings`, `plugins`,
  `mcp`, `native-apps`, `files`, `diff`, `sidebar`, `artifacts`, `popcorn`,
  `ui`, `icons`, `locales`, `markdown`, `queries`, `host`, `config`, and
  `utils`. All directly under the shared `restored/` root — no per-entry folder.
- Preserve chunk identity only in provenance headers and import maps:
  `// Restored from ref/webview/assets/<basename>.js`. Public file and directory
  names are kebab-case and hash-free (React component identifiers stay
  PascalCase: `button.tsx` exports `Button`).
- Prefer target-local barrels (`index.ts`) for split feature folders. Update the
  shared `restored/IMPORT_MAP.json` at the same time as the public files so later
  chunks import the semantic path instead of the hashed chunk.
- Reuse existing restored modules if the hash already maps to a semantic file.
  Do not create parallel modules with slightly different names for the same
  source chunk.

## Stage 3 acceptance review in this repo

Run Stage 3 acceptance review automatically after the deterministic gate, with no
extra confirmation. The host agent performs the acceptance read itself — reading
every delivered file end-to-end against the quality bar — so it needs no sub-agent
and no authorization, and is never blocked by their absence. If the runtime offers a
reviewer/sub-agent tool _and_ the user has authorized delegation, you may use it
for independent eyes (`prepare-stage-e-review.ts <target>` then `--verify`
batches the packets); otherwise just read the files yourself and proceed. Never
report "reviewer unavailable" as though Stage 3 acceptance review could not run,
and never pretend files passed without an actual read.

After acceptance, run the final whole-target gate:

```bash
bun .agents/skills/deobfuscate-javascript/scripts/quality-gate.ts restored
```

This command understands this repo's legacy `IMPORT_MAP.json` sections
(`chunks`, `boundaries`, `appScope`, `vscodeApi`, `src`, `statsig`) as well as
newer `publicOutputs`. It is the guard against the recurring failure where most
files look mapped but many app chunks remain mechanical or placeholder outputs.
Do not accept a boundary-only audit, a count of placeholder files under
`boundaries/`, or `status: "done"` as proof of a complete deep restore.

## `current-ref` stable-stem chunks: never trust an inherited alias map

`boundaries/current-ref/*-producer.ts` facades map a _current_ build chunk to
prior restored work by **stable stem** (the hash-stripped name), recording the
old hash under `migratedFrom`. The export **alias letters** (`a`, `B`, `_t`, …)
are bundler-assigned and **repack between builds**: when the export _set_ changes
(features added/removed/code-split differently), the minifier reassigns aliases
for the survivors too. So an IMPORT_MAP `exports` map copied from the old hash is
**stale** — its alias→name pairs silently point at the wrong bindings, which
mis-rewrites every consumer that imports the chunk by alias.

When asked to deep-restore a `current-ref` chunk (or any chunk whose map entry
has `migratedFrom` ≠ its current hash), **re-derive from the actual current
file**, do not trust the inherited map:

1. Parse the tail `export { INTERNAL as ALIAS, … }` table from the current file
   → the authoritative alias→internal-binding list.
2. For each internal binding, pull its definition (Babel `path.scope.bindings`)
   and **fingerprint** it against `restored/`: React components by their
   destructured prop-name set + JSX string/`defaultMessage` ids; constants by
   their literal value (e.g. a feature-gate id like `2574306096`); `init*Chunk`
   thunks by the distinctive literal/signal they set up. String literals and prop
   names survive minification, so grep-against-`restored/` is reliable; the alias
   letter is **not**.
3. Diff the re-derived semantic-name _set_ (not the alias set) vs the old map to
   find genuinely added/removed exports. Newly-added exports are real new modules
   to restore; they are not "already done" just because the stem matched.
4. Rebuild the producer barrel to exactly the current name set and rewrite the
   IMPORT_MAP `exports`; only then is `status: done` honest for this hash.

This is parallelizable: fan out one fingerprint agent per ~15-20 exports.
Worked example: `app-initial~app-main~automations-page` went `BfqUlSo6` (141
exports) → `Bc0ZtIBr` (105 exports); aliases fully repacked (`B` went from
`isKeyboardShortcutCommandFeatureEnabled` to `isSameProcessRow`), and 6 exports
were net-new (remote-hosted-pip state, keyboard-shortcuts dialog, home-hero
heading, composer-project-list init).

The same fingerprint rule applies when draining legacy aggregator barrels: a
semantic-looking export name is only a hint until the current binding definition
matches it. In the BUw compatibility bundle, for example, the exported binding
`Wa` was labeled `pathsMatch` in the legacy map, but the actual definition is a
React internal stack helper (`e.tag === 22`, `V(qa, ...)`, `B(Ba)`), not a review
path comparator. Do not route such names to restored modules by name alone; verify
the binding body first.

## Aggregator-chunk restore anti-patterns

Large shared runtime chunks (the `app-initial~app-main~*` family, ~43k lines)
are aggregators: they inline the implementations of ~100 shared modules and
re-export them under build-specific aliases. Restoring them has two orthogonal
sub-tasks that must **both** complete:

1. **Alias-map fix (delta task):** re-derive the alias→semantic-name map and
   update `IMPORT_MAP.json` + the `boundaries/current-ref/` producer barrel.
   This is a _narrow_ sub-task that can finish in one session and is described
   in the `current-ref` section above.

2. **Body restoration (organize→promote pipeline):** deobfuscate the chunk body
   (Stage 2 rename + polish → Stage 3 finalize → organize → promote). This
   produces the actual source files in `restored/`. `auto-restore-full.ts`
   generates a mechanical _checkpoint_ as a starting point; that checkpoint
   must be turned into semantic files before the chunk counts as restored.

**These two sub-tasks are independent.** Finishing the alias-map fix (1) does
NOT close the body restoration (2). The manifest `stages` fields track (2)
only. After finishing a delta alias-map fix, always verify whether a
mechanical checkpoint for the chunk body also needs to be promoted.

### Three red flags to check before declaring done

**Red flag 1 — Mechanical-name saturation.**
After `auto-restore-full.ts` runs, count the fallback names:

```bash
grep -c '<entryBasename>Value[0-9]' _full/checkpoints/<basename>.tsx
```

If the count is **> 5,000**, the checkpoint is deep-mechanical and cannot be
promoted as-is. Record the count in the manifest (custom `notes` field or a
`needsAgentRewrite: true` in the auto-restore report) and reset the rename
stage (`ledger.ts reset rename <basename>`) so no downstream process treats
the checkpoint as promoted. Do NOT mark `stages.organized = true` based on a
vendor facade until a semantic rewrite reduces fallback names to near-zero.

**Red flag 2 — `vendor/` path for a large local chunk.**
`plan-organize.ts` may propose `vendor/X-runtime.ts` (or `vendor/X-current-runtime.ts`)
for any chunk whose name contains "runtime" or "current". For a `kind: local`
chunk **> 10k lines**, the `vendor/` domain is almost certainly wrong: a
genuine vendor entry is a small npm-shim stub (< 2 KB); a 43k-line local chunk
needs a domain split. When you see this proposal, **reject it** and manually
assign correct domain paths via `ledger.ts set-organization`. The `vendor/`
domain is reserved for bare npm re-export shims and thin passthrough facades —
not for aggregator bodies.

**Red flag 3 — Facade promoted in place of a body.**
The tell-tale is a large `kind: local`, `classification: app-feature` chunk
marked **`stages.promoted = true`** whose organize-path file is a **pure
re-export barrel** — the `current-ref` producer facade (e.g. the 6.4 KB
`vendor/automations-page-current-runtime.ts`, all `export { … } from "…"`, zero
`function`/`class`/arrow bodies). It means the alias-map sub-task finished and
flipped every stage flag (`renamed`/`polished`/`finalized`/`promoted` all true
via `source: "agent-current-ref-alias"`), but the 43k-line body was never
deobfuscated into semantic files. Do **not** trust the stage flags alone here:
the early symptom `stages.organized = true` while `stages.renamed = false` only
shows _before_ the alias agent flips the flags; once it does, the flags lie and
the **barrel shape** is the reliable signal.

`quality-gate.ts <target>` now detects this directly:
**`full-restoration-aggregator-body-not-restored`** flags any local app-feature
chunk ≥ 4 000 source lines that is promoted to a re-export-only barrel (the size
heuristic — "facade < 2 KB" — was wrong; this facade is 6.4 KB, so the gate
keys off the barrel _shape_, not bytes). Vendor-npm / vendor-runtime
classifications and small chunks are exempt; `--allow-organize-incomplete`
suppresses it for an intermediate run. A clean `quality-gate.ts <target>` is the
proof; do not declare the body done while this code is present.

### Correct closure for an aggregator chunk

After the alias-map fix, the completion path for the body is:

1. Identify modules that are NOT yet in `restored/` by comparing the
   consolidated export fingerprints against actual on-disk files.
2. For each missing module: extract its definition from the ref file, run
   Stage 2 rename + polish (`polish.ts --rename --fast --format`), and write a
   semantic file to the appropriate domain.
3. For modules already well-restored from a prior build: verify quality
   (provenance header, no mechanical names, types) and cross-reference the
   IMPORT_MAP entry to confirm the file path is correct.
4. Once all module bodies are accounted for, update manifest stages:
   `ledger.ts mark-done <basename>` with the correct semantic-name list.
5. Run `quality-gate.ts restored/` over the whole target — the per-chunk
   facade alone is NOT a passing result.
