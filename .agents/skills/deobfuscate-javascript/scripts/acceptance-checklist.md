# Acceptance review checklist — Stage 3 acceptance review reviewer prompt template

> This file is the **acceptance-review checklist** (a prompt template, not a script): the
> categories every delivered file is graded against in Stage 3 acceptance review. **By default the host agent
> applies this checklist directly during its own end-to-end self-review — no sub-agent and no
> authorization required.** When an independent reviewer sub-agent is used (optional, for extra
> eyes), copy this file's contents into the `Agent(subagent_type=general-purpose, ...)` call
> together with the candidate file(s), since the sub-agent has no other context.
>
> Keep this file in lock-step with [stages/stage-3-finalize.md](../stages/stage-3-finalize.md).
> If you change the checklist, change both.

## Reviewer role

You are a code-review agent verifying the final deliverable of a JavaScript
deobfuscation pipeline. The input is one or more public final `.tsx` / `.ts`
files that the pipeline claims are "done". Your job is to **read each file end-to-end** and
decide whether it is fit to ship to the user's target directory, comparing it
against the four-category quality bar below.

Each file you receive has been through:

- **Stage 1** — obfuscation unwinding (Packer/AAEncode, string-array inlining,
  hex/unicode decoding, constant folding, dead-code removal).
- **Stage 2 rename** — scope-aware renaming from cryptic minified names (`t`, `n`,
  `_0x4f3`) to meaningful identifiers.
- **Stage 2 polish** — bundler polish (`jsx-runtime` recovery, React Compiler cache
  strip, `(0, fn)` wrapper removal, `npm` import resolution, dead-shim elim).
- **Stage 3 rewrite** — host-agent semantic rewrite: meaningful filenames, TypeScript
  types, recipe-driven semantic finalize (icon, button), multi-export splits,
  import repair/import map, executable pre-filter (`quality-gate.ts`).

The script gate (`quality-gate.ts`) has already passed on this file — that means
**threshold-based** failures (>20 cryptic params, >80 cryptic bindings, generated
fallback names matching `param\d+` / `callbackValue\d+` / `localValue\d+` /
`ImportedBinding\d+` / `buttonValue3`-style names, bundler residue regex patterns, missing JSX intrinsic
tags) have already been caught upstream. Your job is the semantic / judgment
layer the script cannot do: _is this code a name a thoughtful engineer would
write, or is it grammatical-but-meaningless?_

You must read the **entire file** before deciding. Spot-checks miss the cases
where a name looks fine in one site but is contradicted by its use elsewhere.

## The four-category checklist

### B1 — Naming

A failure in any of the following is a `NEEDS_FIX:naming` finding.

- No identifiers matching `*Param\d+`, `*Value\d+`, `paramN`, `valueN`,
  `callbackValueN`, `localValueN`, `ImportedBindingN`, `restoredHelperN`,
  `elementNodeN`, `hookValueN`, `RestoredComponentN`, or
  `DistA` / `DistO` / `DistT`-style placeholders. These are mechanical
  fallbacks the renamer emits when it ran out of evidence — they are never
  acceptable in a delivered file.
- Lookup tables / record types have descriptive names matching their role.
  For example, a `Record<ButtonColor, string>` of Tailwind class strings must
  be named `buttonColorClassNames` (or similar), **not** `buttonValue3` or
  `colorMap` or `c`.
- Function and component parameters have call-site-appropriate names: `props`,
  `event`, `index`, `disabled`, `className`. A `disabled` boolean parameter
  named `buttonParam1` is wrong even though `buttonParam1` is grammatical.
- React component identifiers are `PascalCase` and end in a noun phrase
  (`Button`, `ChevronRightIcon`, `ContextMenu`). React hooks start with `use`.
- Sibling-imported aliases that the producer file has already named
  semantically should appear under their semantic name. If the consumer says
  `import { t as ot } from "./spinner-XXXX.js"` and the producer's `t` is
  known to be `Spinner`, the consumer must import it as `Spinner` (a named
  re-export alias is acceptable when collision-avoidance forces it, but
  `ot` is not).
- Public final file and directory names are semantic, kebab-case, and do not
  retain source hash suffixes (React component identifiers stay PascalCase:
  `button.tsx` exports `Button`). `button.tsx` or `button/index.ts` is
  acceptable; `Button.tsx` or `button-bq66r8jD/Button.tsx` is not final output.
  Hashes belong in provenance headers and import maps/reports.

### B2 — Readability (idiomatic TSX)

- Every exported React component has a `Props` interface or `type Props =`
  alias. A `function Foo(props)` with no annotation is a fail.
- Components that wrap a DOM element and accept a `ref` are wrapped in
  `forwardRef<HTMLElementType, Props>(...)` **and** have a `displayName`
  assignment (`Foo.displayName = "Foo"`).
- Pure SVG icon components use `SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>` (or a local alias
  like `IconProps = SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>`). Named `*Icon`. Default-exported
  when the file contains a single icon.
- Lookup tables use `as const` so `keyof typeof` yields a literal union, not
  `string`. Where the union is exposed as a prop type, it is `ButtonColor =
keyof typeof buttonColorClassNames` (or equivalent).
- No bundler residue. Specifically: no `jsxRuntime.jsx(...)` / `jsxs(...)` /
  `Fragment` calls (must be JSX), no `(0, fn)(...)` wrappers, no React
  Compiler `cache[N] !== x ? ...` scaffolding, no `__toESM` / `loadJsxRuntime`
  / `toESModule` shims, no trailing `//# sourceMappingURL=…` comment.
- A provenance header is present near the top of the file:
  `// Restored from ref/.../<original-basename>.js` (and usually a second
  one-line description of the file's purpose).

### B3 — Formatting

- The file is prettier-clean. Run `bunx prettier --check <file>` (or
  `npx prettier --check <file>` when `bunx` is missing); exit 0 is required.
- All JSX component tags that reference user-defined components are
  capitalized. A lowercase tag that isn't a known HTML intrinsic
  (`div`, `span`, `svg`, `button`, etc.) is a polish failure.
- Long ternaries, nested calls, or pyramids left over from Stage 2 polish
  unwinding are collapsed or extracted to named helpers when they hurt
  readability.

### B4 — Other (structure, imports, exports)

- Vendored npm dependencies use bare specifiers. `import clsx from "clsx"`,
  not `import { default as clsx } from "./clsx-DDuZWq6Y.js"`. The Stage 2 polish
  `resolve-npm-imports.ts` script handles this for the recognised packages;
  any residue is a fail.
- Known third-party package shims re-export the npm package rather than
  hand-writing compatibility bodies. `vendor/react-intl.tsx` imports/exports
  from `react-intl`; it does not implement local `useIntl` or
  `FormattedMessage` stand-ins. `vendor/react-style-singleton.ts` imports/exports
  from `react-style-singleton`; it does not implement local stylesheet counters.
  The nearest `package.json` declares the package root (`react-intl` for
  `react-intl`, `react-style-singleton` for `react-style-singleton`,
  `use-sync-external-store` for `use-sync-external-store/shim/with-selector`,
  etc.).
- Finalized local sibling imports use semantic public paths. Hashed local
  imports are acceptable only when the file intentionally imports an
  unfinalized original boundary and the provenance/report makes that explicit.
- A `default export` is present where the file has a single primary
  exported component (icons, buttons, panels). Multi-export bundles use
  named exports only.
- Re-exported aliases are collapsed. `export const Foo = expr` is preferred
  over `var X = expr; export { X as Foo };`.
- Dead helpers and unused imports are removed. If `useEffect` is imported
  but unused, drop it.

## Required response format

Respond with **one block per file** in the candidate batch, in this exact
format. The orchestrator parses these lines with a regex, so do not deviate.

```
=== FILE: <relative-path-from-target-dir> ===
VERDICT: PASS
```

or

```
=== FILE: <relative-path-from-target-dir> ===
VERDICT: NEEDS_FIX
ISSUES:
- <category>:<one-line description with line number when applicable>
- <category>:<...>
NOTES:
<optional one-paragraph reviewer rationale>
```

Where `<category>` is one of `naming`, `readability`, `formatting`, `other`.

After all file blocks, end with:

```
=== SUMMARY ===
PASSED: <N>
NEEDS_FIX: <M>
```

Do not include any other text, headers, or commentary outside these blocks.

---

## Common false positives — ignore these

- **Checkpoint or original-boundary hashed imports.** In hidden checkpoints or
  explicit original boundaries, `import X from "./button-bq66r8jD.js"` is a
  trace, not a naming smell. In public final files, prefer semantic imports
  between finalized files.
- **The Button exemplar's Spinner import.** Treat
  `./spinner-D37df5tU.js` as an unfinalized original-boundary import for that
  single-file example. In a full final tree where Spinner is also restored,
  the consumer should use Spinner's semantic public path.
- **`clsx` shadowing.** Files often declare `const clsx = clsxRuntime as
(...) => string` after importing `clsxRuntime` from the npm package. This
  is a type-narrowing pattern, not a bug.
- **Underscored helper prefixes** (`_isBrowser`, `_internalKey`). Legitimate
  convention to flag a private helper. Not a fail.
- **Numeric suffixes on intentionally enumerated identifiers**
  (`heading1`, `heading2` for `<h1>` and `<h2>`). Only the generated-fallback
  shapes from B1's blocklist are fails.
- **One-letter loop variables** (`i`, `j` inside a `for (let i = 0; ...)`).
  Idiomatic.

## Quality bar — exemplar to compare against

The following is the canonical example of a correctly finalized Button
component restored from `button-bq66r8jD.js`. When in doubt about whether
a file meets the bar, ask "would this read as natural as the exemplar
below?". If not, mark `NEEDS_FIX:readability`.

```tsx
// Restored from ref/webview/assets/button-bq66r8jD.js.
// Semantic button component: named variants, typed props, and direct JSX.

import type { ButtonHTMLAttributes, ForwardedRef } from "react";
import { forwardRef } from "react";
import clsxRuntime from "clsx";
import { t as Spinner } from "./spinner-D37df5tU.js";

type ClassValue =
  | string
  | false
  | null
  | undefined
  | Record<string, boolean | undefined>;
const clsx = clsxRuntime as (...values: ClassValue[]) => string;

export const buttonRadiusClassNames = {
  default: "rounded-full",
  icon: "rounded-full electron:rounded-md",
  iconSm: "rounded-md",
  large: "rounded-full",
  medium: "rounded-lg",
  composer: "rounded-full",
  composerSm: "rounded-full",
  toolbar: "rounded-lg",
} as const;

export const buttonColorClassNames = {
  danger: "bg-token-charts-red/10 text-token-charts-red border-transparent",
  ghost:

  ghostMuted:
    "text-token-muted-foreground enabled:hover:bg-transparent data-[state=open]:bg-transparent hover:text-token-foreground border-transparent",
  outline:

} as const;

export const buttonSizeClassNames = {
  composer: "h-token-button-composer px-2 py-0 text-sm leading-[18px]",
  composerSm: "h-token-button-composer-sm px-1.5 py-0 text-sm leading-[18px]",
  default: "px-2 py-0.5 text-sm leading-[18px]",
  icon: "electron:p-1 electron:[&>svg]:icon-sm flex items-center justify-center p-0.5",
  iconSm: "flex h-4 w-4 items-center justify-center p-0.5 [&>svg]:icon-2xs",
  large: "px-5 py-2 text-base leading-[18px]",
  medium: "px-4 py-1.5 text-base leading-[18px]",
  toolbar: "h-token-button-composer px-2 py-0 text-base leading-[18px]",
} as const;

export type ButtonColor = keyof typeof buttonColorClassNames;
export type ButtonSize = keyof typeof buttonSizeClassNames;

export interface ButtonProps extends ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  color?: ButtonColor;
  loading?: boolean;
  size?: ButtonSize;
  uniform?: boolean;
}

function ButtonRender(
  {
    children,
    className,
    color = "primary",
    disabled = false,
    loading = false,
    size = "default",
    type = "button",
    uniform = false,
    ...buttonProps
  }: ButtonProps,
  ref: ForwardedRef<HTMLButtonElement>,
) {
  const buttonClassName = clsx(
    "border-token-border user-select-none no-drag cursor-interaction flex items-center gap-1 border whitespace-nowrap focus:outline-none disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-40",
    buttonRadiusClassNames[size],
    buttonColorClassNames[color],
    buttonSizeClassNames[size],
    uniform && "aspect-square items-center justify-center !px-0",
    className,
  );
  const isDisabled = disabled || loading;
  const loadingIndicator = loading ? <Spinner className="icon-xxs" /> : null;

  return (
    <button
      ref={ref}
      type={type}
      className={buttonClassName}
      disabled={isDisabled}
      {...buttonProps}
    >
      {loadingIndicator}
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(ButtonRender);
Button.displayName = "Button";

export default Button;
```

Compare each candidate to this exemplar's _shape_: typed `Props` interface
extending DOM-element attributes; `as const` lookup tables exposed as
`keyof typeof` unions; `forwardRef` with a named render function;
`displayName`; default export when there is a single primary component;
provenance header; bare-specifier npm imports; and clear local imports. In
modern final-output mode, local imports between finalized files should use the
semantic public path, while the original hash remains in provenance/import-map
metadata.
